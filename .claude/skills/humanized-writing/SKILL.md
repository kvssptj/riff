When applying this skill, rewrite content to sound like it was written by a thoughtful human rather than an AI.

## Guidelines

**Do:**
- Use plain, simple language and short sentences
- Be direct and conversational
- Write like you speak (starting with "and" or "but" is fine)
- Use simple verbs: "shows," "fetches," "routes," "learns"
- Keep paragraphs to 3 sentences or fewer

**Never use these phrases:**
- "let's dive in," "game-changing," "unleash potential"
- "leverage," "synergy," "streamline," "robust," "seamless"
- "revolutionary," "transformative"
- Marketing buzzwords or hype language

## Quality checklist

- Clear narrative from problem → solution → metrics
- Every claim grounded in user pain or data
- Consistent voice and terminology
- No speculative adjectives
- Critical Questions listed for open decisions
