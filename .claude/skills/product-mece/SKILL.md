Apply MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) thinking to structure and analyze product problems systematically.

## MECE Framework

**Mutually Exclusive:** Each item belongs to only one category (no overlap)
**Collectively Exhaustive:** All items are included (nothing is left out)

## When to use MECE

- Breaking down user problems and pain points
- Analyzing features and capabilities
- Prioritizing roadmaps and initiatives
- Segmenting markets or user personas
- Diagnosing product issues
- Making product decisions

## Application process

1. **Define the framework** – What dimension are you organizing by? (e.g., user type, problem area, timeline)
2. **Brainstorm all possibilities** – Get everything out without filtering
3. **Check for gaps** – Are there items that don't fit? (Collectively Exhaustive)
4. **Check for overlaps** – Do any items belong in multiple categories? (Mutually Exclusive)
5. **Refine** – Reorganize until your framework is clean and complete

## Example

Instead of this (overlapping, incomplete):
- Mobile users
- Desktop users
- Enterprise customers

Use this (MECE):
- **By device:** Mobile, Desktop, Tablet
- **By organization type:** Enterprise, Mid-market, SMB, Individual

Each item belongs to exactly one category, and nothing is omitted.
