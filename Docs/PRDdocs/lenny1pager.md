 Instructions: Keep this genuinely short — it's a 1-pager, not a comprehensive PRD. Be direct and opinionated rather than exhaustive. The problem should be a singlestatement. Evidence should be 3-5 strong data points. The solution should describe what users experience, not internal architecture. Every section earns its place by being essential to the decision.
Template Sections
8 sections
Description
What is the product? A brief description so readers can quickly grasp what this project is about. ### Guidelines - 2-3 sentences maximum - A stranger should understand the product after reading this - Avoid jargon and internal codenames - Answer: What does it do? Who is it for?
Problem
The problem as a testable hypothesis. You'll add evidence in the next section. ### Strong Problem Statement Attributes - **Short**: Aim for a single sentence - **Focused**: A single clear problem, owned by one team, solvable in a reasonable time - **Need-based**: References an unmet need (Jobs-To-Be-Done is useful here) - **Has a what AND a why**: What's going wrong, and why it matters - **Solution-agnostic**: Resist jumping to a solution this early ### Examples - *Good*: 'Lyft drivers are cancelling rides too often because the passengers are too far away.' - *Good*: 'Users are dropping off at too high a rate at the final step of the signup flow.' - *Bad*: 'User growth is slowing.' (too broad, not user-centric) - *Bad*: 'Build a loyalty program.' (assumes a solution) - *Bad*: 'Users are bouncing from the signup flow.' (not focused enough, missing the 'why')
Why
How do we know this is a real problem worth solving? Back up your hypothesis. ### Evidence Collect 3-5 strong data points. Quality over quantity: - **Quantitative**: Metrics, funnel data, churn analysis, survey results - **Qualitative**: User interviews, support tickets, session recordings - **Market signals**: Competitor moves, industry trends, analyst reports ### Devil's Advocate Try to convince yourself this ISN'T a real or big enough problem: - What gaps exist in your evidence? - Is the evidence truly telling you what you think? - Could there be a simpler explanation? Your case doesn't have to be airtight — but acknowledge the gaps.
Success
How do we know if we've solved this problem? ### Ideal Success Criteria - **Specific metric**: [Metric name] - **Defined goal**: [X]% increase/decrease - **Measurable**: Can be tracked with current tooling - **Connected to KPIs**: Ties to your team's goals - **Based on data**: Informed by opportunity size and past experiments ### Guidelines - Try hard to make it a concrete number: '10% increase in X,' '50% decrease in Y' - Pick a goal that's believable but ambitious — one your team and leaders would be excited about - If a metric truly doesn't make sense, describe what the world looks like if this is a big success
Audience
Who are we building for? It should rarely be 'all users.' ### Specifics - **User segment**: New vs. returning? Casual vs. power? Free vs. paid? - **Platform**: Mobile, web, both? - **Geography**: All markets or specific regions? - **Size of segment**: What % of your user base does this represent? ### Why This Segment Why focus here first? Biggest pain, largest opportunity, most strategic, etc.
What
Roughly, what does the solution look like in the product? ### Guidelines - Describe what users will experience, not internal architecture - Be as detailed as your team needs (depends on how much is already known) - Include rough mockups, wireframes, or references if available - Highlight the key interaction moments and any major UX decisions ### Format Walk through the core experience: 1. User starts at [context] 2. They see/do [interaction] 3. The result is [outcome]
How
How will we build or test this? ### Approach - **Build**: Full implementation, ship to all users - **Experiment**: A/B test with defined success criteria - **Prototype**: Quick test to validate before full build - **Manual first**: Do it manually to learn before automating ### Technical Considerations - Major technical decisions or constraints - Dependencies on other teams or systems - Known risks or unknowns
When
When does it ship and what are the milestones? ### Timeline | Milestone | Target Date | Owner | |-----------|-------------|-------| | Design complete | [Date] | [Name] | | Build complete | [Date] | [Name] | | Internal testing | [Date] | [Name] | | Ship / Experiment start | [Date] | [Name] | | Results review | [Date] | [Name] | ### Confidence Level How confident are you in this timeline? What could slip and why?
