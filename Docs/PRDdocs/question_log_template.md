## Resolution Tracking

Questions move through: **Open → In Discussion → Resolved** (or **→ Decision Memo** for significant decisions).

When a question is resolved:

2. If the answer is a significant product decision, create a Decision Memo and link it
3. If the answer changes scope, update the relevant Intent Brief
