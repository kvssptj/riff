1. [Goal — with target metric if applicable]
2. [Goal]
3. [Goal]

### Non-Goals
What's explicitly out of scope and why. Call out anything someone might assume is included.

## 5. Solution

### How It Works
Walk through the core experience. Describe what users see and do — not internal architecture.

1. User [starts at / navigates to] [context]
2. They see [what's on screen]
3. They do [action]
4. Result: [what happens]

### Key Flows

**Flow: [Name]**

| Step | Screen / View | User Sees | User Does | Result |
|------|--------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | [View] | [Content] | [Action] | [Outcome] |
| 2 | [View] | [Content] | [Action] | [Outcome] |

### States
- **Empty:** [No data]
- **Loading:** [Fetching]
- **Error:** [Failure]

### Business Rules & Edge Cases

| Rule | When It Applies | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| [Rule] | [Condition] | [Scenario] |
