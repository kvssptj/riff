Instructions: Be evidence-driven and specific throughout. Every claim should reference data, user research, or market insight. Prioritize crisp problem statements and measurable goals over lengthy narratives. The impact sizing model should include actual calculations with stated assumptions. Key flows should be detailed enough that a designer or engineer could build from them without further clarification.

14 sections
Problem
Describe the problem in 1-2 sentences. Someone should be able to read this and communicate the customer and business value + risks. ### Guidelines - State the problem as a hypothesis you can test - Highlight evidence or insights that support this - Include both the **customer pain** and the **business opportunity** - Be specific: 'Users churn after 7 days because they never find [feature]' not 'engagement is low'
High Level Approach
The rough shape of how you might tackle the problem. A few sentences max. ### Guidelines - Describe the approach, not the full solution - This should communicate direction to the team without over-constraining design - Think of it as: 'We're going to solve this by [approach], roughly by [method]'
Narrative
Hypothetical stories that paint a picture of what life looks like for customers today. ### Include - **Common use case**: The typical user scenario (80% of usage) - **Edge case**: An unusual but important scenario that tests the solution - **Before/after**: What life looks like without your solution vs. with it Stories should create empathy and help the team internalize user needs. Make them vivid and specific.
Goals
High-level goals, ideally in priority order. ### Measurable Goals Goals with concrete metrics: - Goal 1: [Metric] from [baseline] to [target] - Goal 2: [Metric] from [baseline] to [target] ### Immeasurable Goals Goals about how the experience should *feel*: - Users should feel [confident/delighted/empowered] when [doing action] - The experience should feel [fast/simple/professional] Keep it short — 3-5 goals max, in priority order.
Metrics
Specific, operationalized metrics to track success. ### North Star Metric The single most important metric: - **Metric**: [Name] - **Current baseline**: [Value] - **Target**: [Value] - **Measurement**: How and where this is tracked ### Secondary Metrics Supporting metrics that indicate progress: - [Metric 2]: [Baseline] → [Target] - [Metric 3]: [Baseline] → [Target] ### Guardrail Metrics Metrics that must NOT degrade: - [Guardrail metric]: Must stay above [threshold] - State what amount of movement would be **unacceptable** and trigger a rollback
Impact Sizing Model
A quantitative model estimating the impact on key metrics. ### Calculation Show your work step by step: 1. **[Input assumption]**: [Number] — source: [where this comes from] 2. **[Input assumption]**: [Number] — source: [where this comes from] 3. **[Calculation step]**: [Formula] = [Result] 4. **[Final estimate]**: Expected impact on north star metric ### Revenue/Bottom-Line Impact - Estimated impact on revenue or profit - Confidence level: Low / Medium / High - Key assumptions that could change the estimate
Non-goals
Explicit areas you do NOT plan to address. ### Format For each non-goal: - **Not doing**: [What you're skipping] - **Why**: [Rationale — too expensive, wrong timing, different team, low impact] ### Guidelines - Non-goals are as important as goals — they prevent scope creep - If someone might reasonably assume it's in scope, call it out as a non-goal - Include things you considered but explicitly decided against
Solution Alignment
Draw the perimeter of the solution. Do not force others to identify scope. ### What's In - Core experience that MUST be built - Quality bar for the initial release ### What's Out - Features saved for later - Quality tradeoffs you're accepting for now ### Open Questions - Decisions that still need input from design/engineering - Areas where you're deliberately leaving room for the team to explore
Key Features: Plan of Record
The features that shape the solution, in priority order. ### Format For each feature: - **Feature**: [Name] - **Priority**: P0 (must ship) / P1 (should ship) / P2 (stretch) - **Description**: What it does and why it matters - **Size estimate**: Small / Medium / Large ### Guidelines - Think of this as drawing the perimeter of the solution space - Challenge each feature: can a smaller version be shipped independently? - The team fills in the details — you define the boundaries
Future Considerations
Features you are saving for later that might inform how you build now. ### Planned Follow-ups - **Feature**: [Description] — Planned for [timeframe/phase] - **Feature**: [Description] — Planned for [timeframe/phase] ### Build-Now Implications Anything about these future features that should influence current architecture or design decisions. Example: 'We'll add multi-language support in Q3, so don't hard-code strings.'
Key Flows
End-to-end experience shown screen by screen. Get detailed here — not high level. ### Format **Flow: [Name]** 1. **Screen**: [Page/view name] - **User sees**: [What's on screen] - **User does**: [Action they take] - **Result**: [What happens next] 2. **Screen**: [Next page/view] - ... ### Guidelines - Walk through every click, not just the high-level steps - Include empty states, loading states, and error states - An engineer should be able to build from this without asking questions
Key Logic
Business rules that guide design and development. ### Rules For each rule: - **Rule**: [Clear statement of the logic] - **Applies when**: [Conditions] - **Example**: [Concrete scenario] ### Edge Cases - What happens when [boundary condition]? - What happens when [unusual input]? - What happens when [concurrent action]? Make it so an engineer feels everything is thought through.
Launch Plan
How this product gets to market. ### Phases For each phase: - **Phase**: [Name] — [Purpose] - **Entry criteria**: What must be true to start this phase - **Exit criteria**: What must be true to move to the next phase - **Duration**: Expected timeline ### Experiment Design (if applicable) - **Type**: A/B test, staged rollout, beta program - **Sample size**: Users needed for statistical significance - **Duration**: Time needed based on north star metric goal - **Success criteria**: What metric movement triggers full launch ### Risks & Dependencies - Risks that can throw a wrench in timelines - Dependencies on other teams or external factors - Contingency plans for each
Key Milestones
The critical checkpoints from now to launch. ### Format | Milestone | Date | Owner | Status | |-----------|------|-------|--------| | Design complete | [Date] | [Name] | [Status] | | Engineering kickoff | [Date] | [Name] | [Status] | | Internal dogfood | [Date] | [Name] | [Status] | | Beta launch | [Date] | [Name] | [Status] | | GA launch | [Date] | [Name] | [Status] | ### Dependencies Call out any milestone that blocks another or depends on an external team.
